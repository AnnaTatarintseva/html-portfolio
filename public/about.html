<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm working as buyer in large e-comm company in Russia.<br />
  In my free time love:
  <ul>
    <li>playing games</li>
    <li>listening to music (collect kpop albums lol)</li>
    <li>learn new  stuff</li>
  </ul>
  The most intresting thing in the past several month for me were Asian phylosophy.<br />
  I think it's very complicated but very intresing.

  My main for this learning project is to prove myself that I can learn somthing and make Broken Compass map as Web Project.<br />
  Also I hope this study helps me to start learning Korean (again) cause it was a goal for me in a long term.
